Satellite Tracker: Refactoring Summary

Overview
1. Modular Architecture: Reorganized the code into logical modules with clear responsibilities
2. Reduced Duplication: Consolidated redundant code across files into shared utilities
3. Improved Abstraction: Created proper classes and interfaces for major components
4. Better Configuration Management: Centralized configuration handling
5. Enhanced CLI Interface: Consolidated command-line tools into a unified interface

Key Components

1. Configuration Management
- Centralized in `common/config.py`
- Consistent handling of configuration files and defaults
- Support for multiple configuration sections

2. GQRX Radio Interface
- Encapsulated in `GqrxController` class in `radio/gqrx.py`
- Robust communication with GQRX via remote control protocol
- Methods for satellite-specific configuration

3. Satellite Pass Prediction
- Moved to `satellites/predictor.py`
- Interface with GPredict for accurate pass predictions
- Fallback to local prediction when GPredict unavailable

4. GPS Integration
- Refactored from your original mobile integration code
- Support for multiple GPS sources (socket, Bluetooth, serial)
- Background location updates for mobile operation

5. Recording Management
- New `RecordingManager` class in `recorder/manager.py`
- Automated pass monitoring and recording
- Support for manual scheduling

6. Command-Line Interface
- Unified interface in `scripts/track_satellite.py`
- Subcommands for different functions (predict, record, etc.)
- Simple interface for basic operations in `scripts/simple_controller.py`

Improvements

1. Code Organization
- Separated concerns into logical modules
- Clear interfaces between components
- Consistent file and module naming

2. Error Handling
- Improved logging throughout
- Better exception handling
- More informative error messages

3. Thread Safety
- Used locks for shared resources
- Better thread management for background processes
- Proper cleanup on exit

4. Configuration
- More flexible configuration options
- Better defaults
- Support for runtime configuration changes

Migration Path

To migrate to the new structure:

1. Create the new directory structure
2. Copy files to their new locations
3. Update imports and references
4. Test each component individually
5. Test the integrated system

Future Enhancements

The refactored architecture makes it easier to add new features:

1. More Satellite Types: Just add to the definitions
2. Additional Radio Backends: Create new controllers following the GQRX pattern
3. Web Interface: Add a web server module using the existing components
4. Signal Processing: Add post-processing modules for decoding satellite data
5. Automatic Decoding: Process recorded files to extract images/data
